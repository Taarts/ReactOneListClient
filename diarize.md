all the usual
added a const to mirror the list of things that are listed on the app page.

Delete all <li> and now map inside the <ul> with "useState". You can add to the state and it is present on the rendered page without any additional code.

added dynamic "className" ternary statement to update the list on completion of each task. Kept as undefined rather than empty for neatness sake.
